        <h3>Early Years</h3>
            <p>Dylan Thomas was born in the year 1990. From a young age, he had an interest in electronics. His father would find him playing video
                games deep into the night, much to young Dylan's chagrin. Throughout high school, it would be common for Dylan to skip a whole night's
                sleep on Saturday's to play through the latest story, on the newest console. Unfortunately, initial college aspirations fell to the 
                wayside due to an unfocused plan.</p>
        <h3>Adulthood</h3>
            <p>After dropping out of college, Dylan's continued interest in electronics followed him. While assembling lifts at
                his wife's family's business, Dylan loved putting together custom computers, and his interest in the inner workings of programs
                themselves has lead him to the DU code bootcamp.</p>
